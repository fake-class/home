# Hello everyone! Soy Daniel

I am from Medellín, Colombia and I have a background in Linguistics and
literature and I am just getting started with my journey in Web Development. I
love self-teaching and enjoy the creative side of web development as well as the
constant exploration. I’m interested in anything front-end related as it is my
current focus!

I’m currently learning CSS, HTML and the basics of JavaScript.
